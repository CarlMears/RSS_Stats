This module contains several classes that accumulate statistics for use in analysis of satellite data

## binned_stats.py 
Contains BinnedStat, a class for accumulating data to calculate binned means and stddevs for "cross" talk plots

## binned_stats_2D 
Contains BinnedStat2D, a class for accumulating data to calculate binned means and stddevs for "cross" talk plots

## hist_1d.py 
Contains Hist1D, a class for accumulating data in the form of 1 dimensional histograms

## hist_2d.py
Contains Hist2D, a class for accumulating data in the for of 2 dimensional histograms

## map_stats.py
Contains MapStat, a class for accumalating data in rectangular geographical maps

## polar_map_stats.py
